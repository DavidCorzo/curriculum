I like to learn especially things that are related to computer science and automation, my goal in life is to learn, one can not go through life without learning and thus my favorite hobby is to learn. Recently I've contracted an interest in music that I have combined with my pasion for computer science and I'm currently working on a program to learn music. My other great hobby is mathematics, I love math I sometimes program mathematic algorithms for fun and see how can a computer be tought what to do and how to do it to prove theorems and mysteries not yet available until recently. For example if you visit my github page you will find some programs on integration of a function, musical algorithms, calculus and mathematical profs that I do not only to learn but to also as a hobby.
